### Two games made using Gamemaker Studio: Bronzepunk and Mijnlieff
* Bronzepunk was made last year for the Ludum Dare game jam. I worked with an artist and a musician to put together a short point-and-click adventure game.

* Mijnlieff is an adaptation of a tabletop game by the same name. It plays like a more complex Noughts and Crosses, with a 4x4 board and each tile posessing special rules.
